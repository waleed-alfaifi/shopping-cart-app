## How to run the app locally

_You need to have **Nodejs** (preferably the LTS version) and **MongoDB** installed on your machine._

1. Download this project into your machine.
2. In the root direcotry of the project, open a terminal and run `npm install`. After that's done, run `npm run install-c`.
3. Finally, run `npm run dev` and you should have Node server with React dev server running on port 5000 and 3000, respectively.

There is one last step you should do, though.

4. Import the _items-collection.json_ collection file (that's available in the root direcotry of the project) into the _items collection_ of your local database. You can do that easily using [MongoDB Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/import-export/#procedure).

Now, you are good to go!
